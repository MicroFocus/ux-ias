# Micro Focus ux-ias

UX Library for Identity, Access, and Security Products (ux-ias) is the official CSS framework 
for web applications built by Micro Focus Identity, Access, and Security Group. These guidelines 
help establish a consistent look and feel among common user interface elements throughout Identity 
Access, and Security products. This documentation contains information about components, user 
experience (UX) patterns, and application layout. It also contains the required structure and options 
for the HTML that uses this framework.

This is only a CSS framework. Interactive components shown in this framework are not functional (they can
only be viewed). Please refer to [ng-ias](https://github.com/microfocus/ng-ias) to view a fully functional 
implementation of these components.
