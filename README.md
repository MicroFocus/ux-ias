# Micro Focus ux-ias

Identity and Access UX Guidelines (ux-ias) is the official CSS framework for web applications built by Micro Focus 
Identity and Access Management Group. These guidelines help establish a consistent look and feel among common
user interface elements throughout Identity and Access Management Group products. This documentation contains
information about components, user experience (UX) patterns, and application layout. It also contains the
required structure and options for the HTML that uses this framework.

This is only a CSS framework. Interactive components shown in this framework are not functional (they can
only be viewed). Please refer to ng-ias to view a fully functional implementation of these components.
