# MicroFocus UX
MicroFocus Identity and Access Management Group has defined a set of style and user experience (UX) guidelines for browser-based web applications. This guide serves as both a formal specification and reference implentation of these UX guidelines.

## Building
### Software prerequisites
- node >= v6.2.2
- npm >= v3.9.5

1. `npm install -g gulp-cli`

## Demos
This reference implementation is built using strictly HTML/CSS. Because this reference implementation contains no Javascript logic, the behavior of the components is not dynamic. For a fully functional reference implentation, see (github.com/jedwardhawkins/ng-mfux).
